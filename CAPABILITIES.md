# Capability status

Labels: **IMPLEMENTED** is code/contract tested; **HOST-VERIFIED** adds sanitized real-host evidence;
**FOUNDATION** is a documented or partial seam not yet an end-to-end feature; **PLANNED** has no
stable implementation; **UNSUPPORTED** is deliberately excluded.

Phase 2 preserves `Capability != Provider` and adds
`Capability existence != runtime executability`. A manifest describes what a Worker can provide;
only a fresh execution-plane observation proves whether it can execute that capability now. See
[`docs/MULTI_NODE_EXECUTION_PLANE.md`](docs/MULTI_NODE_EXECUTION_PLANE.md).

```

Only `serve` starts Supervisor. Bootstrap remains a host-operation dry-run even with `--emit` or a
durable state database; those options write only review/lifecycle state. Recording a result never
executes the referenced operation. No command starts, installs, authenticates, exposes, or registers
a provider Worker
implicitly. Token creation is the only listed command that emits a credential and stores only its
salted hash.

The bundled production Local Worker daemon is loopback-only and requires an owner-only 0600 bearer
file. Its HTTP contract accepts a registered driver ID and bounded semantic inference request, never
an executable, shell string, argv, environment, working directory, plugin, or arbitrary URL. Native
driver profiles are operator-owned files loaded at daemon startup; the deterministic TestDriver and
all test seams are rejected by `--production`.

Codex availability means only that a reviewed executable profile is intact; authentication,
subscription plan, quota, and provider-native resume remain unknown until the CLI reports them.

## Fabric naming boundaries

A capability is a provider-independent description of work, not a provider name and not an
authorization grant. A Worker binds an adapter/runtime to declared capabilities; permission,
privacy, approval, health, quota, and locality remain separate routing inputs. See
[`docs/CAPABILITY_FABRIC.md`](docs/CAPABILITY_FABRIC.md).

An Interaction channel is not a Worker. It identifies the observation/action medium used by a
scheduled semantic interaction execution. The current end-to-end acceptance uses a deterministic
local fixture and does not demonstrate control of a real OS, browser, screen parser, LLM, or VLM.
See [`docs/INTERACTION_FABRIC.md`](docs/INTERACTION_FABRIC.md).
